## Warning Warning Warning

This is just an exploration of ideas for how to handle mixer configuration for
adapters moving forward. This is not considered to be an authoritative guide
for any purpose. It also does not represent the design decisions of any larger
team or of Istio in general.

### What's here

There is one top-level file representing what we might expect some developer or
vendor to supply in the definition of what we were previously calling "aspects".
This is the `metrics.proto` file.

The rest of the `*.go` files in this directory are meant to represent what
generated content from `metrics.proto` might look like. `metrics.pb.go` was generated
with `protoc`. `instance.gen.go` and `processor.gen.go` were edited by hand in
a manner closely-reflecting discussions around what might be generated by a new
mixer config processing framework.

`adapter/prometheus` provides a look at what an adapter that provided a Processor
for the new type of data in the mixer might look like.
